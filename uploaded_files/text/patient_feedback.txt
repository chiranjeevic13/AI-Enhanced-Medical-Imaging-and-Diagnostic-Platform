Over the past three days, I have been experiencing persistent throat pain that seems to worsen each day. Along with the sore throat, I've had a mild fever and general fatigue, making it difficult to carry out daily activities. The discomfort in my throat has been accompanied by occasional difficulty swallowing, and Iâ€™m concerned about the possibility of a more serious underlying condition. I haven't noticed any other symptoms like a rash or shortness of breath, but the persistent nature of the pain and fever is troubling. I plan to seek medical attention if the symptoms do not improve soon.
